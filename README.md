# Crowd Airway BSc project 2018

* viewAndProcessResults --- nog opschonen zie github
* filterUsefullResults.m - Filters the data, generated by viewAndProcessResults.m, based on the criteria described. Returns the filtered versions of the input tables of this file and some additional columns.
* separatingTasks.m - Creates an cell which contains specific information of each image of the dataset. The rows indicate the image of the dataset. The rows of images without useable annotations will be empty.
* scatterplotInnervsOuterAnnotation.m - Creates a scatterplot of the airway lumen vs. airway wall annotations of the KWs. Each dot is an individual annotation result. It also creates the same scatterplot for the expert's measurements, but this contains less points because each image is only described by one person.  
* scatterplotPerImage.m - Creates a scatter plot of expert-vs-KW for both airway lumen and airway wall. The annotations of the KWs are median combined. So, each image is one scatter point. 
* otherScatter.m - Creates a scatter plot expert-vs-KW of specific images. The lumen and wall of the corresponding image are shown in the same color. 
* wapSubject.m - Tests difference in mean wall area percentage between CF subjects and healthy subjects. One WAP per subject is calculated. So, means were calculated over the crowd annotations and over the images of one subject.
