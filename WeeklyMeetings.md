### Date: 07/05/2018

#### What did you achieve this week?

* Read multiple articles to get an understanding of crowdsourcing.
* Described a problem definition
* Created some milestones
* Tried to understand the scripts that I've got
* Created scatterplots of inner or outer area's of expert's and KW's annotations combined by median.
	* Added an gtTablePerTask as output of 'viewAndProcessResults.m' which is needed when only one annotation per task is analyzed. 
	* Created 'scatterplotPerImage.m' this script first filters the results of the knowledge workers and only keeps those with 2 annotations performed that were classified as usefull. 
	  Then it combines the expert's data and also the knowledge worker's data. The median area's of those groups will be visualized in a scatterplot.

#### What did you struggle with?

* To know where to start and what to look for.
* It took quite some time to get an create an overall picture of the data (e.g. which data is used and where to find the data) and to keep this overview clear.
* Working in an efficient way.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Add airway properties (wall thickness, wall thickness ratio)
* I'd like to find usefull articles on the defined problem.
* More specific work on the problem/ to work towards clearly defined milestones. 
 

#### Where do you need help?

* You suggested to think about other analyses that could be done. Did you mean something like wall thickness or ratio's or a kind of statistical analyse


#### Any other topics

* I thought this might be an interesting article, but I don't have access to it.

* 'Solved' the merge problem by manually changing the additions in my local files. Don't know yet if this will give problems when pushing my files to github.
* When is the deadline of the paper?
* Is it okay if all issues, planning etc. on github are in dutch?
